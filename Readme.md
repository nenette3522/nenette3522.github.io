# My Port-folio Website

## Description
You are in the repository of my port-folio website.
The website looks like shit for now because I just wanted to see if it worked.
Its purpose is to present a few projects I've been working (and will work) on my learning path at Codecademy.
I started to learn how to code around 3 months ago.
